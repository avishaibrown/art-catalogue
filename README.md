# Drawboard React Coding Exercise

## Overview
Thanks for taking a look at the Drawboard React Coding Exercise, we appreciate you taking the time to give this a bash - hopefully you will find it fun to complete.

[Drawboard](https://drawboard.com.au/) provides real time markup and document management platforms for architects, engineers, students - you name it.

The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your approach to application development and problem-solving in a way that is similar to what we do day to day here at Drawboard.

## Context
The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy. The Museum lives in two iconic sites in New York City—The Met Fifth Avenue and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience online.

The MET provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection [via its API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).

## The task
You've been tasked to create a React app that displays images and information from the MET art collection, via an infinite scrolling page.  
Users of the app should be able to scroll down the page infinitely to view new images, similar to Instagram's continuous scroll functionality.

The design of the UI, and any information you want to display alongside the images, is up to you.  
We are not looking for fancy designs, but it should be useful to a user and nice to use. Is the app useful to the user? Does it display errors appropriately? etc.

## Extending
Try adding a couple of small pieces of functionality that you feel would be useful to demonstrate your capabilities.  
Some ideas include: keyword search, displaying additional information, linking out to relevant websites, filter by department, using additional APIs etc.  
Don't feel obliged to spend too long here - we care about quality over quantity.


## Testing
Please add enough tests to demonstrate your testing capabilities. You don't need to cover everything, but some key areas would be great.

## Expectations

The kinds of things we will be looking for when we evaluate your submission include:

- Solid design principles
- An architecture that is testable and extensible
- Ability to produce reusable components
- Error checking and reporting
- Convenient UI/UX
- Useful commit messages that help show your process and the app's evolution

## Nice to have
- A utility class CSS styling approach would be great (Eg, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/))
- Code structure and adherence to JS/React development with a functional approach (Eg, [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/))

If you get stuck on anything small, just make a best guess. We're interested in problem-solving, and love initiative.  

## Other considerations
- Please be kind to any APIs you use, and adhere to rate-limit requests
- Does the app need to be responsive?
- What gets displayed when there's no image in a response?
- When the app is refreshed, do we get the same images every time?

## Submission
We will supply this task by giving you a zip file. Please use the git repo the project is contained in, and add your commits there.

When you are finished you can send your submission back to us as a zip file that includes any changes you’ve made and any other information you think is useful.

## Feedback
We’re always trying to improve our hiring process. This task is designed for you to be able to show your JS/React development skills without spending a huge amount of time on it. We welcome any feedback on how this could be improved.

If you have any questions or need clarification, please email Troy at troy.daniels@drawboard.com

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
